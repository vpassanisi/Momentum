This is a full stack application using Vue(TypeScript), Go, and MongoDB. It is a clone of Reddit! So you can create subreddits, make posts to those subreddits, and have comment conversations within a post. There is also a points system where users can upvote or downvote posts and comments and subsequently sort post and comments by their points. The Frontend is fully responsive and looks great on desktop and mobile.

Technologies Used:

- Vue and TypeScript
- Go and Fiber
- MongoDB via Mongo-Go-Driver
